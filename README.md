## 🐳 Quick Start with Docker
The easiest way to run WealthFam is using our pre-built Docker image. You don't need to build anything yourself!

1. **Create a directory** for your data and configuration:
   ```bash
   mkdir wealthfam && cd wealthfam
   ```

2. **Create a `docker-compose.yml` file**:
   ```yaml
   version: '3.8'
   services:
     wealthfam:
       image: wglabz/wealthfam:latest
       container_name: wealthfam
       restart: unless-stopped
       ports:
         - "80:80"
       volumes:
         - ./data:/data
       environment:
         - DATABASE_URL=duckdb:////data/family_finance_v3.duckdb
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```
   Open [http://localhost](http://localhost) in your browser.

## 🔄 Data Ingestion Flow

WealthFam features a sophisticated, multi-channel ingestion pipeline designed to minimize manual entry while maintaining 100% data accuracy through smart deduplication and noise reduction. 

### How it Works:
1.  **Multi-Channel Entry**: Data enters via the **Android Mobile App** (real-time SMS), **Automated Email Scanning** (IMAP sync for txn alerts and CAS statements), or **Manual Uploads** (Bank CSVs and Mutual Fund PDFs).
2.  **Safety & Noise Reduction**:
    *   **MD5 Deduplication**: Every incoming message generates a unique content hash. The system checks this against both confirmed and pending transactions to prevent duplicates even if emails are re-scanned.
    *   **Ignore Patterns**: A global filter that silently drops known "noise" (like login alerts or non-transactional bank updates) based on merchant names or message subjects.
3.  **Tiered Parsing Intelligence**: Validated messages are processed through a three-tier engine:
    *   **Static Parsers**: Hardcoded high-performance logic for major banks.
    *   **Pattern Parser (Learned)**: User-trained regex patterns that evolve as you use the tool.
    *   **AI Fallback**: Large Language Model (Gemini) parsing for complex or unknown formats.
4.  **The Human-in-the-loop**: Messages that fail all parsers are moved to the **Training Area**. Labels generate new patterns, while "Discard & Ignore" actions update the global noise filters.
5.  **Automatic Categorization**: Validated transactions are automatically categorized or sent to **Triage** for final review.
